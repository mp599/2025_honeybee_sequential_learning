Statistical learning is a key cognitive mechanism for detecting regularities from sensory inputs. Among its implementations is the extraction of regularities from sequential inputs, an adaptive trait that enables species to predict future events and guide behavior. Learning of sequential inputs has been observed in vertebrates, including humans, non-human primates, and birds, leaving open the question of what is the minimum computational architecture to extract regularities from sequential inputs. To tackle this issue, we used the honeybee (Apis mellifera) as an invertebrate model and showed that bees could learn and recall the temporal order of olfactory stimuli presented sequentially. Our findings show that the ability to detect regularities from sequential sensory inputs is not exclusive to vertebrates but represents a fundamental component of a conserved cognitive toolkit.
